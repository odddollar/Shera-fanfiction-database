    <h1>She-ra recommended fanfictions database</h1>
    <p>Created out of necessity as there are so many good fanfics recommended
       by the great people of <a href="https://www.archiveofourown.org/users/silkarc">silkarc</a>'s discord server. <br>
       This is a very basic attempt at a database website that allows people to upload their recommended fics for others to see</p>
